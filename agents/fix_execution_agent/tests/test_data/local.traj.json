Explain why you want to perform the action.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\nFailure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.\nTo finish, issue the following command: `echo MINI_SWE_AGENT_FINAL_OUTPUT`\nwithout any other command.\n"

Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. Every response must contain exactly one action\n2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks\n3. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n   However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n4. To finish, issue the following command: `echo MINI_SWE_AGENT_FINAL_OUTPUT`.\n   Do not combine it with any other command.\n\n## Formatting your response\n\nHere is an example of a correct response:\n\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\n## Useful command examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n\n```bash\nanything\n```"
