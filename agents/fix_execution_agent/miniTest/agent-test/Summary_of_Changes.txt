Summary of Changes

Issue Fixed
Fixed a syntax error in the calculate_average function where the for loop was missing a colon, causing a SyntaxError when running the code.

Files Modified

C:\Users\86138\Desktop\白白\模式设计\大作业\CodeAgent\agents\fix_execution_agent\miniTest\error.py
Change: Added missing colon (':') at the end of the for loop statement
Location: Line 3, changed 'for num in numbers' to 'for num in numbers:'
Reason: Python syntax requires a colon after for loop statements to indicate the start of the loop body

Testing
- Original test case [85, 90, 78, 92] now correctly returns 86.25
- Multiple edge cases tested successfully including:
  * All same numbers [100, 100, 100] -> 100.0
  * All zeros [0, 0, 0] -> 0.0
  * Sequential numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> 3.0
  * Single number [10] -> 10.0
  * Mixed positive and negative numbers [-5, 0, 5] -> 0.0
  * Empty list correctly raises ZeroDivisionError
- Script now executes without syntax errors
