Summary of Changes

Issue Fixed
Restored the deprecated `Config.from_json` method that was incorrectly removed in Flask 2.0. The method now properly shows a deprecation warning and delegates to the recommended `Config.from_file` method with `json.load`.

Files Modified

src/flask/config.py
Change: Added the deprecated `from_json` method that was missing from the Config class
Location: Added after the `from_file` method and before the `from_mapping` method
Implementation: The method imports warnings, shows a deprecation warning, imports json, and calls `self.from_file(filename, load=json.load, silent=silent)`
Reason: The method was completely removed instead of being deprecated as stated in the changelog

Testing
- Created comprehensive test script that verifies:
  - `from_json` method now exists and is callable
  - Proper deprecation warning is shown when using the method
  - Method correctly loads configuration from JSON files
  - Silent parameter works correctly for missing files
  - Error handling works correctly when file is missing and silent=False
  - The recommended alternative (from_file with json.load) continues to work
- All existing Flask configuration tests pass (16/16)
- Custom tests confirm the fix works correctly for various scenarios
