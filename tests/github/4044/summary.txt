Summary of Changes

Issue Fixed
Fixed typing for get_send_file_max_age method to accept an optional string parameter and return 
an optional int. The method was previously typed to accept only str but in practice is called 
with None when send_file is used with file-like objects without a filename.

Files Modified

src/flask/scaffold.py
Change: Updated the typing annotation for the filename parameter in get_send_file_max_age method 
from str to Optional[str]
Location: Line 291, method signature
Reason: The method is called by send_file with None as the filename parameter when dealing with 
file-like objects, so the typing should reflect that the parameter is optional

Testing
- All existing Flask helper tests pass (30/30)
- All existing Flask blueprint tests related to static files pass (2/2)
- Custom validation tests confirm the fix works correctly for:
  * String parameters (e.g., "test.txt")
  * None parameter 
  * Empty string parameter
  * Custom implementations that override the method
- Verified that send_file works correctly with file-like objects that have no filename
