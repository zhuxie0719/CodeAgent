Summary of Changes 
Issue Fixed 
Prevent blueprint names from containing dots by raising a ValueError when a dot is detected in the blueprint name. 
Files Modified 
1. src/flask/blueprints.py 
Change: Added validation in the Blueprint class constructor to check if the blueprint name contains a dot (‘.’)
Location: Before self.name = name assignment in __init__ method
Validation: if "." in name: raise ValueError("Blueprint names may not contain dots.") 
2. tests/test_blueprints.py 
Change: Updated test_dotted_names test to use underscores instead of dots in blueprint names
Reason: The test was specifically testing dotted blueprint names which are now invalid
Preserved: The test’s intent (testing URL generation between blueprints) remains unchanged 
Testing 
All existing Flask blueprint tests pass (49/49)
Custom tests confirm the fix works correctly for various edge cases
Blueprints with dots in names now properly raise ValueError
Blueprints without dots continue to work normally
